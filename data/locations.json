The campgrounds themselves consist of two main areas: One area with large, permanent tents for public shelter, dining, etc. and one area designated for those bringing their own tents, yurts, and more. Littered across the area are various small merchant stalls selling anything from the bare essentials to imported trinkets. While the Arpentus peoples make up a majority of the population, there are also a few people who come and go looking for the stories and trinkets that these nomads bring with them."

The fort is kept by powerful magic users who study arcane artifacts in secret, keeping a heavy lock on many powerful magic items and weapons. The fort is extraordinarily well protected, and the keepers also help by keeping the bridge in working order and ensuring safe passage for those who want to cross. Those who try to get too close to the fort, however, will find incredibly heavy resistance, and may not make it back alive. It got its name from long ago before Blackwood fell, where a fierce battle was waged over the contents held in the inner sanctums. Legends have it that when the tide of battle looked poor for the spellcasters, the strongest among them stood forth and cast back tides of warriors and bandits with nothing but a few ancient words. Almost noone goes in or out of the fort, but every once in a while small magical items and scrolls are sent out from the fort to be traded for other goods by a messenger. This messenger is known very well by those native to Karametus, and not even the bravest and strongest bandits dare mess with this delivery."

On top of that, the city as a whole is remarkably safe, aside from those affiliated with The Eye.\nLastly, the SFIA’s main base of operations is here, as well as many of their operatives. The local authorities are often hesitant about the magic items they store at the HQ, but allow it.  ",
            "description": "A very gated community, requiring a weapon check and a good reason in order to enter. AFPA has sent enough Dread Hunters that the guards at the gate will trust those with proof, but others are not always so fortunate. The city imports raw materials and has multiple refineries and skilled craftsmen, so they export many refined and manufactured goods.\nMagic is fairly common in Allapon, though very few use it. Magic is generally reserved for those in the guard and security systems, or for craftsmen seeking to give an extra flair to their creations.  \nAllapon was not always so heavily guarded. Before Blackwood fell, the town was open to all sorts of people from all sorts of walks of life, and was known as a safe haven from crime because of its top notch security and well trained guards. When Blackwood fell, the leaders of Allapon were terrified that they might be next, and walled off the city, increasing security tenfold and adding plenty of magical defenses. It is still known as a safe haven from crime of all varieties, but it is not as welcoming as it was before.  \n"

Its docks are often filled with boats going to and from the town, dropping off all sorts of unique goods and people. Unlike many other cities in Karametus, you’ll rarely see the same person twice in Fairport, as the residential area is not nearly as large as the commercial area. Magic is not uncommon, with there being several churches, a couple of which are capable of greater healing magic, as well as a handful of shops that will sell magic goods and services.  \nDread Hunters are not too commonly seen wandering around the town, although they do make up a small portion of the town’s guards. They also use this position of authority to bring followers of The Fears to justice, arresting or killing them whenever they can."

The only people left are those truly desperate for work or fledgling adventurers looking for the creatures that dwell in the mines and surrounding forest. Magic is very uncommon here, used only by those who gained education from other places, or those born with it innately.  \nAs stated, Valesh used to be a major producer of raw metals and minerals from the mines, but the well has run dry and all that's left are near-barren caves where monstrous creatures have taken residence. Those brave or desperate enough to delve into unexplored parts may find more precious metals that have yet to be claimed, but the journey to untrodden ground grows longer with each day. On the bright side, the lack of economy means that crime is also relatively low due to the residents not having valuables worth stealing, especially compared to cities like Fairport and the merchants that pass by the Trail Outpost."

No survivors were found, although there are plenty who claim their ancestors were there the day after its ruin to behold the tragedy that had befallen the once powerful city.\nNow all that remains is a massive pile of ruins, long since burnt and buried and collapsed. The only animals that seem to linger are those birds brave enough to warn any foolish trespassers that may approach, as well as outlaws keen on looting what little is left and making their hideouts in these no-man's lands.<br><br>The Tragedy of Blackwood: “The royal family once lived in the prosperous city of Blackwood, where they were in the center of each town in Karametus, keeping them all connected. One night, out of nowhere, the entire city was laid to ruin. There were no surviving witnesses to recall the incident, but they say that when the merchants came in the next morning to sell their imports, the gates were sealed tightly shut. After a few hours some people decided to break in, and when they did they found nothing but smoldering wreckage and bodies littered across the once busy roads. The entire city was searched and not a single survivor was found. Furthermore, almost every building was burned down or collapsed, and the castle was nothing but a massive pile of rubble.”"
